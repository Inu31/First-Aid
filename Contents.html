                                        The reason plaster is used after repositioning the bone is that plaster can be well molded to the patient, and therefore it can support the bone more precisely. When a bone was out of position and is manipulated back into position, plaster may be used to help hold the bone in the proper position.
                                        
                                        The problem with plaster is that it is heavy and must remain dry. Plaster casts are a burden for the patient because of their bulky and heavy material. </td>

It may be used in emergencies, in surgery, or in post-operative rehabilitation.What are the 2 types of tourniquet?
                                        Generally, there are two types of tourniquets: surgery and emergency. Surgical Tourniquets are used in orthopaedic and plastic surgeries for creation of a bloodless field, greater safety, better precision, and more convenience for the surgeon. Another use of the tourniquet is as a regional anaesthetic.</td>
